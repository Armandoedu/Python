#RegistrationScreen

Studying a graphical interface in Python, I created a registration screen, where the user enters their information with name, telephone number, biography, and this information is added to a text file. I will be adding more elements to the registration screen throughout my studies.

For now there is only one function (the one that adds information to the file), but, in the course of studies, other functions will be added.
